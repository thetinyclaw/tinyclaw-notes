## BrainBytes Bug Investigation

- **Issue:** Users sometimes cannot submit entries — text entered, press Enter, nothing happens
- **Root Cause:** Silent early return when `selectedTopic` is null or content empty
- **Fix:** Added shake animation to input box when validation fails (using Framer Motion)
  - Added `shakeKey` state
  - Shake triggers on Enter press when no topic selected or empty content
  - Animation: `{ x: [0, -8, 8, -8, 8, 0] }` over 400ms

## Workspace Issue

- BrainBytes local repo had wrong remote URL (pointed to flight-tracker)
- Replaced with fresh clone from github.com/thetinyclaw/BrainBytes
- Re-applied shake fix to correct codebase
- Lost local sqlite.db and brainbytes.log in the process

## Files Modified

- `BrainBytes/src/components/InputArea.tsx` — shake animation on validation failure

## Notes

- The shake animation uses Framer Motion which was already in the project
- Validation now gives immediate visual feedback instead of silent failure
- Should consider adding try/catch around createNote() for server error handling (deferred)
